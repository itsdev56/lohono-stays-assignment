1. The authentication of user is not enabled as of now so i am assuming a user by my name to complete the booking flow.
2. One User can place multiple bookings
3. The Calendar doesnot allow backdated pages and also the last day for advance booking can be till 31 december only. For new year
   calendar needs to be changed
4. CheckOut of the hotel is not handled as of now. So there is no provision in the website for checking out of the hotel
5. Addresses of each city level has been taken same as this is a dummy data
6. At the end of the journey the user details of the booking is stored in the database
7. For now i am not taking number of guests into consideration (maximum guests inputed with allowed number of guests). Can be taken up in modification
